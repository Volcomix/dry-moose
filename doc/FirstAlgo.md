1. **MACD (12, 26 with signal 9)** -
We wait it crosses it's signal line.

2. **Moving Average 9 and 21** -
After MACD crosses its signal, we wait and see if MA9 crosses MA21 ton confirm.
Then we check MACD still going away from 0 and its signal.

3. **Bollinger Bands** -
We check if during step 2 band width increased and is above a given threshold.
Else we don't go to step 4 right now, we wait and see if it will however increase later.

4. If we are here, the trend will continue for a while so...
